    "# Graded Lab Assignment 2: Evaluate classifiers (10 points)\n",

    "In this assignment you will optimize and compare the perfomance of a parametric (logistic regression) and non-parametric (k-nearest neighbours) classifier on the MNIST dataset.\n",

    "This notebook consists of three parts: design, implementation, results & analysis. \n",
    "We provide you with the design of the experiment and you have to implement it and analyse the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Criteria used for grading\n",
    "* Explain and analyse all results.\n",
    "* Make your notebook easy to read. When you are finished take your time to review it!\n",
    "* You do not want to repeat the same chunks of code multiply times. If your need to do so, write a function. \n",
    "* The implementation part of this assignment needs careful design before you start coding. You could start by writing pseudocode.\n",
    "* In this exercise the insights are important. Do not hide them somewhere in the comments in the implementation, but put them in the Analysis part\n",
    "* Take care that all the figures and tables are well labeled and numbered so that you can easily refer to them.\n",
    "* A plot should have a title and axes labels.\n",
    "* You may find that not everything is 100% specified in this assignment. That is correct! Like in real life you probably have to make some choices. Motivate your choices.\n"
